# MindDo Frontend Feature Inventory

## Purpose

This document records the current frontend system scope for the MindDo prototype.

It is designed for three practical uses:

1. Review what has already been implemented.
2. Locate the file and storage entry for each feature quickly.
3. Remove a feature safely later without searching the whole project blindly.

This document should be updated whenever a visible user-facing module, dashboard capability, or local demo data flow is added or removed.

## Current System Scope

The current frontend prototype now covers a usable end-to-end education operations flow:

1. Public business overview
2. Trial registration
3. Assessment and sample quiz
4. Student sign-up and existing-account login
5. Course selection and membership
6. Student home after login
7. Feedback and semester reporting
8. Operations dashboard
9. Special lists for newly registered trials and students
10. Student leave/reschedule request and dashboard-side visibility
11. Student management workspace
12. Operator request processing center with status updates

## Page Map

### `index.html`

Purpose:
Main system landing page / unified entry hub.

Primary users:
Parents, students, operators, internal stakeholders.

Key role in system:
Acts as the main front door for the full frontend system and links into the high-frequency pages by role and usage.

Current implemented capabilities:

1. Center-style marketing hero section
2. Strong top-level CTA for trial, registration, and assessment
3. Role-based portals for visitor, student, and operations
4. Full page library for all available prototype pages
5. Parent/student review section for trust-building
6. Closing CTA band for high-conversion entry
7. Bilingual switching consistent with the rest of the site
8. No project explanation blocks; this page now focuses only on entry and navigation

Safe removal note:
If only the front-door landing is not needed, this file can be simplified or replaced without breaking the shared local data flow logic.

## Shared Frontend Data Layer

### Main helper file

File:
`assets/minddo-flow.js`

Primary role:
Acts as the shared local demo state layer across pages.

Current exported/shared responsibilities:

1. Current student state
2. Lead save
3. Assessment save
4. Signup save
5. Payment save
6. Membership save
7. Feedback save
8. Prefill helpers
9. Demo data seed
10. Floating flow test panel
11. Centralized schedule request read/write helpers
12. Request status update helper for operations

### Storage Keys In Use

These keys are currently part of the demo frontend state model:

- `minddo_current_student`
- `minddo_signup_users`
- `minddo_assessments`
- `minddo_trial_leads`
- `minddo_payments`
- `minddo_feedback`
- `minddo_membership_orders`
- `minddo_schedule_requests`

Important note:
`minddo_schedule_requests` is now shared through `assets/minddo-flow.js`, and both student-side submission and operator-side processing rely on it.

### Medium Priority

1. Search and filtering across trial and payment records
2. Better risk indicators for missing feedback or inactive students
3. Parent contact timeline
4. Multi-role navigation shell

## Definition Of “Usable Frontend” For This Prototype

For this project, a usable frontend means:

1. A user can enter from landing, trial, assessment, or sign-up.
2. A student can register or log in.
3. A student can reach a complete student home page after login.
4. A student can view profile, course selection, schedule, assessment, and feedback entry points.
5. A student can submit leave/reschedule requests.
6. Operations can see new trials, new students, payments, and request activity on the dashboard.
7. Demo data moves across pages consistently through local storage.

The system already satisfies that prototype-level definition.

## Maintenance Rule

Whenever a new visible frontend capability is added, update this document with:

1. Feature name
2. File location
3. Related local storage key or shared helper
4. Safe removal instructions

That keeps the prototype extensible without becoming hard to trim later.
